This is my first ever app created not with a tutorial.  This is for practice only.

The goal is to have a simple way of keeping tack of general to-do's (more about how I want to live) and the daily practice.  Hopefully, I'll eventually be able to put in a record of the time I spend, as well as be able to graph these settings.
